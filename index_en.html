<h3>Who am I ?</h3>

<p>
  I've been working as a web developer during the last 5 years.
  I've built some e-commerce websites with <a href="http://magento.com">Magento</a>.
  I've also built REST APIs with <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony2</a> and mobile webviews with <a
    href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> at <a href="http://tech.m6web.fr">M6Web</a>.<br/>
  I'm now an independent consultant and I aim to help companies solve the issues they may encounter while building web
  software.
