## Professional experiences

### [Smile](http://www.smile.fr) - Development Engineer

#### Jan 2013 - today : [M6Web](http://tech.m6web.fr) - Symfony2, Angular
In [M6Web](http://tech.m6web.fr)'s [Cytron Team](http://cytron.fr), I'm building many REST APIs with Symfony2.
These APIs supply content to [M6Info By MSN](http://news.fr.msn.com/m6-actualite/) and to M6 Group's mobile applications.
We're also building [Angular](https://angularjs.org) webviews for these apps.

#### Jul 2012 - Dec 2012 : [ANWB](http://webwinkel.anwb.nl/webwinkel) - Magento EE
I've worked on customers and orders data exchange between Magento and the ERP using SOAP Webservices.
I optimized checkout performances to allow 2000 orders per hour.

#### Jul 2011 - Aug 2012 : [Decitre](http://www.decitre.fr) - Magento CE
We have highly customized Magento to improve performances with more than 1.5 millions of products.
To achieve that, all product data is denormalized and saved in a SolR instance in order to lower down the number of SQL queries.
I optimized the SQL queries that import product data into the database and into SolR.
I've also made the data migration of customers, orders, carts and wishlist from the old website.

#### Nov 2010 - Jun 2011 : [PourMonBureau](http://www.pourmonbureau.com) - Magento EE
I participated in the creation of this B2B office furniture webshop.
I worked on products imports from CSV files and orders and customers exports to the ERP via SOAP webservices.
I configured Varnish as a reverse-proxy cache in front of Magento.

#### Apr 2010 - Oct 2010 : [Made In Design](http://www.madeindesign.com) - Magento EE
In the webshop reworking, I most notably realized a fraud detection module which marks some orders as needing manual validation.

### Ascomedia - Web Developer
#### Jun 2009 - Aug 2009
I built a PHP website for a jeweller to allow his clients to request estimates online.
The critical point was the price calculus of a ring given its model, size and gold and diamond prices.
